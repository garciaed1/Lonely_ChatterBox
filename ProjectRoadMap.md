The following is a road map that will be used to ensure the completion of this project in a timely manner.

1. Create GitHub Repository
2. Join the KSU-IS GitHub Project
3. Research existing ChatBot projects, various sources
4. Compile a list of packages that can be used
5. Code basic ChatBot functionality
    1. Runs with little to no interaction
    2. Provides a basic response, can be hardcoded
6. Code the repository
    1. Provide a list of responses the ChatBot will use
7. Add the repository responses to the ChatBot
    1. ChatBot should be able to read from the repository and provide a response...doesn't need to be correct
8. Configure the ChatBot to respond with appropriate response from the repository
    1. Will have to develop keywords that tie back to the list of responses
